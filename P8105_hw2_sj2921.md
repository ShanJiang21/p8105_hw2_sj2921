## Problem 1

  - import data from csv file and do some cleaning.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
library(tidyverse)
  
NYC_Transit <- 
    read_csv(file = "./dataset_import/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")
    NYC_Transit <- janitor::clean_names(NYC_Transit)

## Retain line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance.

NYC_df <- select(NYC_Transit, line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada)
```

  - Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical
    variable

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# The conversion to logical variable.
NYC_df$vending <- 
  ifelse(NYC_Transit$vending == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)
NYC_df$entry <- 
  ifelse(NYC_Transit$entry == "YES",TRUE, FALSE)
```

  - **Brief summary of data**: this dataset contains the basic
    information in NYC metro, includes the Subway line(street/avenue),
    station name, the latitude and longtitude of each station, and the
    routes existed. Besides, the subset also contains if there is entry
    or vending for each station, the type of entrance and if is
    compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act.

  - **Data cleaning steps**:

<!-- end list -->

1.  Import data from selected sheet;
2.  Use `Janitor:: clean names` as efficient way to clean variable
    names;
3.  Adopt the select to retain the variables in need. After doing this,
    the data is basically readable, however, it’s not clean enough.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Dimension**: there are 20 column as variables and 1868 rows as
    observations in the dataset.

## Question (Problem1.1):

``` r
# Distinct stations in the dataset as of 465;
stations <- nrow(distinct(NYC_df, line, station_name))

# stations are ADA compliant as of 84;
ADA_no <- NYC_df %>% 
   filter(NYC_df$ada == TRUE) %>%
   distinct(line, station_name) 


# The propotion of station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance is 3.94%
No_vd <- NYC_df %>% 
   filter(NYC_df$vending == FALSE) %>%
   filter(entry == TRUE) 
Percent <- (nrow(No_vd) / sum(NYC_df$entry))
```

1.  According to above, there are 465 distinct stations in NYC.
2.  Also, through filtering we can know that there are 84 stations which
    are ADA compliant.
3.  The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow
    entrance is 0.0393611.

<!-- end list -->

  - Reformat data as
NYC\_tidy\_data

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Make wide data turn to long data, route number and route name are distinct variables.
NYC_tidy_data <- NYC_df %>% 
    gather(key = route_name, value = route_number, 5:15) 

# 60 distinct stations serve the A train
route_A <- 
  NYC_tidy_data %>%
  distinct(line, station_name, station_name,.keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(route_number == "A") 

# Of the stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant
ADA_compliant <- NYC_tidy_data %>%
  filter(route_number == "A") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, station_name,.keep_all = TRUE)%>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) 
```

1.  60 distinct stations serve the A train;
2.  Of the stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

  - Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Load the sheet and specify the range to omit the notes.
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
trw_df <- readxl::read_excel(path =   "./dataset_import/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",sheet = 1, range = "A2:N338")

# Clean variable names 
trw_df <- janitor::clean_names(trw_df)

# omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
trw_df <- trw_df %>% 
  filter(trw_df$dumpster != "NA") 

# rounds the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)
trw_df$`sports_balls` <- 
  as.integer(round(trw_df$`sports_balls`, digits = 0))

#calculate the total weight of gabbages in the year of 2017
weight_17 <- trw_df %>% 
  filter(year != 2017) 
  
sum_weight <- sum(weight_17$weight_tons)
```

  - import precipitation data in 2016 &
2017

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Read 2017 precipitation data, clean names of variable, add a variable as year 2017
Precp_17 <- 
  readxl::read_excel(path =   "./dataset_import/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",sheet = 4, skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(total != "NA", month != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017)


# Read 2016 precipitation data, clean names of variable, add a variable as year 2016
Precp_16 <- readxl::read_excel(path =   "./dataset_import/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx",sheet = 5, skip = 1 ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(total != "NA", month != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(year = 2016)

## combine datasets and rename the variable:
Precp <- right_join(Precp_17, Precp_16, by = "month") 
  
names(Precp)[3] <- "Year1"  
names(Precp)[5] <- "Year2" 

names(Precp)[2] <- "Precipitation1"
names(Precp)[4] <- "Precipitation2"

# convert month to a character variable (the variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).
Precp$month <- as.character(month.name[Precp$month])

# Combine the new data frame organized.
Precp_df <- 
  Precp %>% 
  select(month, Year1, Precipitation1, Year2, Precipitation2) 

# calculate the total precipitation in 2017
sum_17_precp <- sum(Precp_df$Precipitation1, na.rm = TRUE)

# calculate the median of sportsballs in 2016
Ball_02 <- trw_df %>% 
    filter(year == 2016) 

med_sports <- median(Ball_02$`sports_balls`)

# Mean of Plastic bottles collected in 2017. 
sum_trw <- 
  trw_df %>% 
     filter(year == 2017)  

mean_plastic <- mean(sum_trw$plastic_bottles)
mean_plastic <- round(mean_plastic, digits = 0)

# sum of cigarette butts in the total period.
sum_cig <- sum(trw_df$cigarette_butts, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## key variables

  - The number of observations in 2016 is precpitation data 12;
  - The number of observations in 2017 precpitation data is 12;
  - The total precipitation in 2017 is 32.93;
  - The the median of sportsballs in 2016 is 26.
  - The total weight of dumpster in 2017 is 760.1;
  - The mean of glass bottles in 2017 is 1998.
  - The sum of cigrette butts for the last five years are 1.0289610^{7}.

  - In the scatter plot, we can see that the NY-New York County gets
    more excellent response from the 2002 to 2010 than that of the
    NY-Queens County as the NY-New York County has a mean of `{}`
